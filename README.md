Changes in this mod

- New harvestable and installable body part definition: Kurin tail, available for both HAR or Deluxe edition Kurins
- New tailor bench recipe: Skin kurin tail. Requires 1 kurin tail, produces 50...
- New wool type material: Kurin fur
- New thought: "Kurin wearing kurin" for Kurins wearing apparel made of kurin fur. Similar to humans wearing human leather, except more visceral. Cannibals, psychopaths, and blood lusters are immune to the negative thought and instead get a positive boost.
- New social thought: "Wearing kurin fur" for Kurins seeing someone else wearing kurin fur. They really don't like it. They REALLY don't like seeing another Kurin wearing their sisters.

Mod compatibility

- Kurin HAR Edition or Kurin Deluxe Edition. Both tested to work, although the flavor text makes more sense with the female only HAR Edition. When using HAR Edition, the recipe for the Kurin Tale Blade is modified to require only 1 advanced component, but now needs a fresh kurin tail.
- Harvest Everything!: When detected, kurin ears are also added as a harvestable and installable body part
- Harvest Organs Post Mortem: Kurin tails (and ears with Harvest Everything) are added to the autopsy drop list
- Combat Extended: the battle fox raiding party hating your entire fur-clad colony makes combat extra spicy.
