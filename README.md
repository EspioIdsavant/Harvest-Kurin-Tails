# Harvest ~~Kurin~~ All The Tails
A Rimworld mod to allow the harvesting and use of various Animal-kin tails.  All supported races allow the user to harvest (willingly or not) the tails of the races, which can then be used to replace tails on other pawns of the same race.  For many races there are alternative uses available, where appropriate.  None of the race mods listed below are required to run this mod; it dynamically adjusts the content available based on the race mods you have loaded.
In addition, if you have the Harvest Everything mod installed, this will also unlock harvesting and installation of additional race-specific body parts like ears or horns where they are defined.
If you have the Harvest Organs Post Mortem mod installed, tails and the HE bonus items will have a chance to appear in autopsies.

### Kurin
- Supported mods: Kurin HAR Edition; Kurin, the Three Tailed Fox \[Deluxe Edition\]
- HE bonuses: Ears
- Alternative tail uses: Can be skinned at a tailoring bench, producing Kurin Tail Fur, a wool-like material that can be used to make stuff.  Be warned, Kurins dislike wearing Kurin Fur clothing even more then humans dislike human leather, and they dislike seeing others wearing thier sister's fur.  If they see another Kurin wearing Kurin, they will view them as a traitor!  Nopte that psychopaths, cannibals, and bloodlusters will instead take glee in wearing Kurin fur.
- Other change: For Kurin HAR Edition, the recipe for the Kurin Tail Blade is modified to require only 1 advanced component, but now needs a fresh kurin tail.

### Ineligable Races/Mods
These are races or mods that unfortunately can not be brought into the harvesting fold because the way the tail part is implemented is as a cosmetic attachment, and not an actual body part.
- Revia from *Revia Race - biotech*
- Dragonian from *Gloomy Dragonian Race*
